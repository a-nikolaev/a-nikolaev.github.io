## Assignments

Lab assignments will be posted on Blackboard **4 hours before** the class starts. 
Please read the tasks before you come to class. You will be submitting lab solutions through [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com/courses/13715/). 
Make your best attempt to finish and submit all tasks by the end of the class. 
Lab submission deadline will be extended **24 hours after** the end of the class.
(Bear in mind that the assignment visibility on Gradescope will not match this deadline.)

Plagiarism is not allowed. Each program you submit, must be your own individual work.
To be clear: discussing the programs and algorithms with your classmates is good and acceptable,
however each person writes their own program. Copying someone else's code is not allowed.

### Style Check

At the end of the lab, the instructor checks code style for every student. 
This serves two goals: to give you advice on your code, which cannot be done automatically via Gradescope, 
and also to check your attendance. The **style check is mandatory**. 
Failure to attend the class and show your code results in a grade penalty for that lab (up to 1/3 of the grade). 

### Grades for CS-135 and CS-136
All CS-135 assignments (programming projects and tests) contribute to your CS-135 grade.
Whereas all labs contribute only to your CS-136 grade. Both classes follow the same grading criteria.

For more detailed information, see your CS-135 syllabus.
