## A Unix environment on your computer
  If your OS is:
  
  **Linux**. You already have everything. Make sure to install **g++** if it is not already there. 
  
  **OSX**.
  You already have everything. It may come with **g++** pre-installed. However, if it's not the case, install Xcode or its Command Line Tools.
  [This link](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/) may be helpful.
  Open the Terminal and you are good to go.     

  **Windows**.
  Install [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/). 
  [These instructions](http://cs.calvin.edu/curriculum/cs/112/resources/installingEclipse/cygwin/) (although a bit old) can help you 
  to install it together with **g++**.
  When installing Cygwin, make sure you chose to install **gcc-g++** package.    

  **Web-based**. 
  If the above options don't work for you, there is a good
  [online development environment](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_cpp_online.php).

## Text Editor
  **For this class, I strongly discourage using Xcode or any other IDE.** We need only a text editor and a terminal window.
  
  **On Mac OSX**, use a simpler text editor, for example [TextMate](http://macromates.com/download) or [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/),
  they are good free options. Use it only for editing code, run your programs from the terminal.
  
  **On Windows**, [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) are a good free text editors I can recommend.

  ** If you are using Vim (and Vi) text editor:**
  The editor does not come with a good default configuration.
  Please refer to this [quick guide](/cs136/vim/) to make it suitable for editing code.
