<h1>HW 2.</h1>

<p><strong>Due Saturday, March 7, by 11:59pm (Midnight).</strong></p>

<p>All programs should be submitted through Blackboard (Course Materials > HW2).</p>

<p>Each program should start with a comment that contains your name and a short program description, for example:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cm">/*
  Author: Your Name 
  Description: HW 1. Task 1. Printing a rectangle
  .. you may add a more detailed description if it's necessary ..
*/</span>
</code></pre>


<p>If a program does not do what it&rsquo;s supposed to do (e.g. there are some bugs,
it behaves differently, or maybe even does not compile), then
its &ldquo;incomplete&rdquo; status must be clearly mentioned in the comment to the program.
In this case, please briefly describe what is implemented, and what is not.</p>

<h3>Task 1. Von Neumann&rsquo;s Middle Square Pseudo-random number generator</h3>

<p>In the video <a href="http://youtu.be/itaMNuWLzJo">Random vs Pseudo-random</a>,
we learned about von Neumann&rsquo;s algorithm for generating pseudo-random numbers:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="420" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/itaMNuWLzJo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>The algorithm is called the Middle square method, and it generates a sequence of pseudo-random <em>n</em>-digit numbers.
In this task, we will be generating <strong>4-digit</strong> pseudo-random numbers.</p>

<p>To setup the generator, a 4-digit number must chosen as a seed.
We assign this value to a global variable, let&rsquo;s call it <code>state</code>, it will store the state of the generator.</p>

<p>To generate the next pseudo-random number in the sequence, the value of the variable <code>state</code> is squared,
producing an 8-digit integer (if it&rsquo;s shorter, we assume that it&rsquo;s padded with leading zeroes),
and we take its middle 4 digits! This is it.</p>

<p>This new value is returned from the procedure, and <code>state</code> is also updated with this new number.</p>

<p>Write two functions that implement the Middle square PRNG:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// set the seed (the seed must be a 4-digit number)
</span><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">seed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="c1">// generate the next pseudo-random number
</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">gen</span><span class="p">();</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Also write a <code>main</code> function that tests your pseudo-random number generator.</p>

<h3>Task 2. Cycles in von Neumann&rsquo;s PRNG</h3>

<p>Any pseudo-random sequence eventually starts repeating itself.
No matter with what seed you start, the sequence will eventually converge to one of the cycles.</p>

<p>Read a discussion of this issue in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-square_method">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>

<p>Using arrays you can keep track of the numbers visited by the PRNG and identify such cycles.
For this task, please write a program that identifies all cycles of von Neumann&rsquo;s PRNG.</p>

<hr />

<p>It turns out that there are <strong>5 cycles of length one</strong>.  <br/>
Examples:</p>

<pre><code>0 -&gt; 0 -&gt; 0 -&gt; ...
100 -&gt; 100 -&gt; 100 -&gt; ...
3792 -&gt; 3792 -&gt; ...
</code></pre>

<p>And <strong>3 cycles of length four</strong>.  <br/>
Example:</p>

<pre><code>540 -&gt; 2916 -&gt; 5030 -&gt; 3009 -&gt; 540
</code></pre>

<p>There are no cycles other than these eight. And in particular, there are no cycles longer than length four.</p>

<p>Your program should find all of these eight cycles and print them out.
Try to come up with an algorithm that prints all cycles exactly once. In other words, when a cycles is found,
you can remember that, and don&rsquo;t print the same cycle again.</p>
