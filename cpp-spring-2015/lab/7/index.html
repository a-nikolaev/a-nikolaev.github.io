<h1>Lab 7. Abstract data types. Implementation and testing.</h1>

<h2>How to submit your code</h2>

<p>Each program (the source code .cpp file) should be submitted through Blackboard (Course Materials > Lab).</p>

<p>You can submit all your programs at the end of the lab session in one submission. This way, we can hopefully avoid
the situation when you are quickly writing your program, immediately uploading it to Blackboard,
but then, say 10 minutes later, realizing that there is a bug in it.</p>

<p>Basically, submit when you are sure that it will be your final version.</p>

<p>Each program should start with a comment that contains your name and a short program description, for example:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cm">/*
  Author: Your Name 
  Description: Lab 1. Task 1. Hello world
*/</span>
</code></pre>


<p>You can submit incomplete programs, but their &ldquo;incomplete&rdquo; status must be clearly mentioned in the comment to the program.
In this case, also briefly describe what is implemented, and what is not.</p>

<h2>Scheduler - intro.</h2>

<p>You work at a certain software development company, and the management is sure that
the programmers are not used optimally. So, they devised a program to help scheduling
when the programmers should work, and for how long.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/qwRCVX9.jpg" alt="mngmnt" /></p>

<p>Of course, they devised the thing, and you have to implement it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/zuv9QEb.png" alt="24 time slots" /></p>

<ul>
<li>the program helps to schedule one working day.</li>
<li>A day is divided into 24 one-hour long time slots.</li>
<li>Only one employee can be assigned to work per time slot.</li>
<li>According to the local labor laws, an employee cannot be scheduled
to work for more than 12 hours in total per day (for example, two
disjoint intervals of 7 hours are prohibited, because 7+7 > 12).</li>
</ul>

<h3>The interface of the data type Scheduler</h3>

<p>You are provided with the specification, what the scheduler is supposed to do.
In addition to the specification, you are provided with a whole bunch
of unit test that will test the functions you implement.</p>

<p>The class declaration looks like this (the main function and the tests are not included here
to keep it short):</p>

<h3>Task 1. Implement the abstract data type Scheduler.</h3>

<p>Implement all public member functions of the class <code>Scheduler</code>.
Check the unit tests, make sure that your implementation passes all of them.</p>

<h3>Task 2. Write your own unit test.</h3>

<p>After your class is ready and passes the tests, come up with a new additional
unit test for one of the member functions of the class and write the code for it.
Write a short comment about what property your test is checking.</p>
