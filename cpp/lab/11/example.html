  <h1>Intro to HTML</h1>
  
  <p> We are going to consider only very basic features of HTML. 
  For text formatting, you use special tags (<em>markup elements enclosed
  between angular brackets</em>). </p>

  <p> Each paragraph should be enclosed in its own paragraph tag (p). 
  A paragraph can span multiple lines: the browser wraps the lines 
  automatically. Multiple whitespace characters and new line characters 
  are discarded by the browser, so you have to rely on the paragraph 
  tags to format the page. </p>

  <h2>Adding emphasis</h2>
  <p> The tag em can be used to <em>emphasize certain phrases</em>,
  the browser shows it with the <em>italic</em> typeface. </p>
