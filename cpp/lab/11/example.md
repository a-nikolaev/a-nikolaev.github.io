# Intro to HTML
We are going to consider only very basic features of HTML. 
For text formatting, you use special tags (*markup elements enclosed
between angular brackets*).

Each paragraph should be enclosed in its own paragraph tag (p). 
A paragraph can span multiple lines: the browser wraps the lines 
automatically. Multiple whitespace characters and new line characters 
are discarded by the browser, so you have to rely on the paragraph 
tags to format the page. 

## Adding emphasis
The tag em can be used to *emphasize certain phrases*, the browser 
shows it with the *italic* typeface.
