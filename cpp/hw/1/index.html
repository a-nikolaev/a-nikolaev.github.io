<h1>HW 1.</h1>

<p><strong>Due Saturday, Feb 14, by 11:59pm (Midnight).</strong></p>

<p>All programs should be submitted through Blackboard (Course Materials > HW1).</p>

<p>Each program should start with a comment that contains your name and a short program description, for example:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cm">/*
  Author: Your Name 
  Description: HW 1. Task 1. Printing a rectangle
  .. you may add a more detailed description if it's necessary ..
*/</span>
</code></pre>


<h3>Task 1. Printing a rectangle</h3>

<p>Write a program that asks the user to input two positive integers,
call them &ldquo;width&rdquo; and &ldquo;height&rdquo;. After that, the program should print out a rectangle of dot <code>'.'</code> characters
with the requested width and height.</p>

<p>If some input numbers happened to be non-positive, don&rsquo;t print anything.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre><code>Please, enter the width = 12
Please, enter the height = 7
............
............
............
............
............
............
............
</code></pre>

<h3>Task 2. Printing a grid</h3>

<p>A modification of the previous task. Again, the program asks the user to input two positive integers.</p>

<p>Then it should print a rectangle of <code>'.'</code>, but now every 5th row and every 5th column
should be printed with the hash <code>'#'</code> character instead of <code>'.'</code>.</p>

<p>For this problem, you may make use of the modulo operator (<code>%</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre><code>Please, enter the width = 19
Please, enter the height = 13

</code></pre>

<h3>Task 3. Graph paper</h3>

<p>The same as the previous task, but the horizontal lines should be drawn with dashes <code>'-'</code>, the vertical
lines should be drawn with the vertical bars <code>'|'</code>, and their intersections drawn with pluses <code>'+'</code>.</p>

<p>Also, instead of the dots, print whitespace characters <code>' '</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre><code>Please, enter the width = 19
Please, enter the height = 13
+----+----+----+---
|    |    |    |   
|    |    |    |   
|    |    |    |   
|    |    |    |   
+----+----+----+---
|    |    |    |   
|    |    |    |   
|    |    |    |   
|    |    |    |   
+----+----+----+---
|    |    |    |   
|    |    |    |   
</code></pre>

<h3>Task 4. Diamond</h3>

<p>Ask the user to input a positive odd integer.</p>

<p>The program should <strong>keep asking</strong> until the input integer is indeed odd and positive.</p>

<p>Assuming that the input number is <em>N</em>, print a diamond that has the height <em>N</em> and the width <em>N</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre><code>Please, enter a positive odd number: 10
Please, enter a positive odd number: -3
Please, enter a positive odd number: 7
