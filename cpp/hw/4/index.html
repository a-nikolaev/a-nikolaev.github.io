<h1>HW4 (Project). Aperture Science Labs: Human Resources Management.</h1>

<p><strong>Due Saturday, May 16 (or 23?), by 11:59pm (Midnight).</strong></p>

<p>There is only one task and only one program to be submitted.</p>

<p>The program should start with a comment that contains your name and a short program description, for example:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cm">/*
  Author: Your Name 
  Description: HW 4. Project. Aperture Science HR.
  .. you may add a more detailed description if it's necessary ..
*/</span>
</code></pre>


<p>If a program does not do what it&rsquo;s supposed to do (e.g. there are some bugs,
it behaves differently, or maybe even does not compile), then
its &ldquo;incomplete&rdquo; status must be clearly mentioned in the comment to the program.
In this case, please briefly describe what is implemented, and what is not.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/pFSxRXL.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In accordance with the company anti-smoking policy,
the Human Resources department of <em>Aperture Science Laboratories</em>
wants to implement a new secret surveillance system for monitoring their personnel.
This is probably an illegal thing to do, but the company lawyers believe that this is fine, and who are you
to argue with that?</p>

<p>New smoke detectors and employee tracking devices have been setup and they already accumulate valuable data.
However, there is no software to process these data yet. Congratulations, this is your job to write it,
isn&rsquo;t it exciting?!</p>

<h2>Program Specification</h2>

<p>The new software should be run from the terminal with 3 command line arguments:</p>

<pre><code>  ./program employees.dat tracking.dat smoke.dat
</code></pre>

<p>If the number of command line arguments is less than 3, the program should exit immediately
with an error message.</p>

<p>All arguments are file names. If the program cannot open these files, it should exit
with an error message.</p>

<h3>File formats</h3>

<p><strong>Employees data</strong></p>

<pre><code># Number of employees
5
# EmployeeID FirstName LastName OfficeLocation
  11         John      Johnson  513
  37         Michael   Burke    11
  24         Mary      Clark    8 
  183        Vincent   Cent     11 
  19         Roseline  Harp     5
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>OfficeLocation</code> field is the place where the employee works, and it&rsquo;s expected that the employee
spends at least 75% of their time at this place.</p>

<p><strong>Tracking data</strong></p>

<p>All information from the employee tracking devices is listed here</p>

<pre><code># Number of entries
53
# Timestamp EmployeeID Location
  105       11         61
  105       24         6
  105       37         17
  105       19         8
  106       37         17
  106       24         5
  106       19         8
  106       11         62
  106       183        20
  107       37         17
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>(In this file, there is supposed to be exactly one record per timestamp for every employee,
however, observe that due to infrequent tracking device failures, the locations of some employees are not
reported at some timestamps, assume that their location is unknown at those time intervals)</p>

<p><strong>Smoke detectors data</strong></p>

<p>This datafile lists all locations where smoke was detected</p>

<pre><code># Number of entries
7
# Timestamp Location
  106       62
  107       213
  110       11
  112       11
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>EmployeeID</code> and <code>Location</code> values are positive integers, but they can be large.</p>

<p><strong>Converting a <code>string</code> to <code>int</code></strong></p>

<p>The easiest way to convert a <code>string</code> to <code>int</code> is to use the function <code>stoi(s)</code>, however
it&rsquo;s a part of the C++11 language standard, and to compile such code with <code>g++</code>,
you have to run the compiler with an additional comamnd line option <code>-std=c++11</code>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>g++ -std=c++11 -o program program.cpp
</code></pre>

<h3>Example data files</h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"> >>>
[<a href="employee.dat">employee.dat</a>]
[<a href="tracking.dat">tracking.dat</a>]
[<a href="smoke.dat">smoke.dat</a>]
&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>Your code should be general, and should work for any dataset that complies with the file formats.</p>

<p>You only may assume that the &ldquo;tracking&rdquo; and &ldquo;smoke&rdquo; data are given sorted in the order of increasing <em>Timestamp</em>.</p>

<h3>User Interface</h3>

<p>The program should provide the following Menu:</p>

<pre><code>Main menu:
a - Report slackers.
b - Report suspected smokers.
c - Report employee's friends. 
d - Identify broken tracking devices.
e - Exit
</code></pre>

<p>The program should read the user input, and if it&rsquo;s not <code>a</code> - <code>e</code>, it should print the menu again.
If the user enters <code>a</code> - <code>d</code> the program should execute the corresponding section.
If the user input is <code>e</code>, the program should exit.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reporting slackers.</strong>
Report those employees who spend at least 25% of the time not at their office.</p>

<p>After that the program should return to the main menu.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reporting suspected smokers.</strong>
The program should print the list of all people who spent at least 2% of the time in the rooms where smoke was detected.</p>

<p>Then the program should return to the main menu.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reporting employee&rsquo;s friends</strong>.
The program should ask for the first name and the last name of an employee.
Then report an error message if the employee is not found, otherwise the program should print out
the <strong>sorted list of at most 10 people</strong> with whom the inquired employee was most frequently observed
together, and who don&rsquo;t work at the same location with him or her.</p>

<p>The list of friends should be sorted according to the number of times they were seen together in the same room
with the queried employee. If the number of possible friends is greater than 10, print only the information
about 10 closest friends.</p>

<p>After that, the program returns to the main menu.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identifying broken tracking devices</strong>.
The program should find the list of all employees whose tracking devices malfunction and report at less than 95% of the timestamps.</p>

<p>After that, the program should return to the main menu.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>The program should be implemented using at least 4-5 classes  and/or structures,
in at least 3 files (for example, one header file, one implementation file, and one main file).</p>

<p>Always try to separate your code into functions and classes where it&rsquo;s possible,
especially where it makes your program more readable, more modular, or where it lets you reuse the code.</p>

<p>Think well about the program design, which classes and functions you may find useful.
Don&rsquo;t afraid changing the code that&rsquo;s already written if you see an opportunity to make it better, even if it requires
rewriting certain parts, but improves the overall structure of your program.</p>

<p>The quality of the overall program organization will be graded as well as the correctness of the program implementation.</p>

<p>You should write a Makefile for building your program, or write exact instructions how to compile the code from the command line using <code>g++</code>.</p>
