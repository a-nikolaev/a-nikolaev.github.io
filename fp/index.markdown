### Overview

This is a practical hands-on course on functional programming using OCaml. We will be solving programming problems in class, in groups and individually.
Small homework assigned every week for better material retention. A project in the second half of the semester, in which you will be 
implementing a program or tool of your choice using functional programming principles. A final exam at the end of the semester.

### Grading 
- 25% attendance and work in class
- 15% homework
- 45% project
- 15% final exam
