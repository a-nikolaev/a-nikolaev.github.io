### Overview

This is a practical hands-on course on functional programming using OCaml. The goals of the course are:
to help you learn the functional programming paradigm, and more broadly, to improve your ability to learn any new technology or programming language,
which will make you a better programmer and computer scientist.

We will be solving programming problems in class, in groups and individually.
Small homework assigned every class for better material retention. A project in the second half of the semester, in which you will be 
implementing a program or tool of your choice using functional programming principles. A final exam at the end of the semester.

### Grading 
- 25% attendance and work in class
- 15% homework
- 40% project
- 20% final exam
