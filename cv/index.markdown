## Research

**Network Science: Teams and higher-order interactions.**
With Saad Mneimneh and Amotz Bar-Noy.
Study collaborative networks of teams using an
[abstract simplicial complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_simplicial_complex) model.
Studied metrics for evaluating *strength* of such collaborative networks

Proposed an *evolutionary generation process* for simplicial complex networks with
the *preferential attachment* property and the facet degree distribution following a power law
\[[poster&nbsp;![pdf][pdfimg]](/docs/poster-netscix-2017.pdf)\].
Research real-life networks of teams, such as Wikipedia Talk pages, call-graph networks in source code, DBLP. 
Simulated bots' interaction and their performance with [Volunteer Science](https://volunteerscience.com/) project.

**Systems Biology: Stochastic approximation for Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs).**
With Felisa Vazquez-Abad. A hybrid model for estimating periodic oscillations in gene regulatory networks

\[[paper&nbsp;![pdf][pdfimg]](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0dc2/58e96178c50e18c7d19734216609c95e1602.pdf)].

**Computational Biology: Protein folding.**

\[[run&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;browser&nbsp;![][runimg]](http://a-nikolaev.github.io/counting/)\].

**Modeling semiconductor-electrolyte nano-devices (Master's thesis).**
With Maria Gracheva. Developed a model for a semiconductor membrane with a nanopore
submerged in KCl electrolyte. Its electrostatic (Poisson-Boltzmann) and dynamic (Poisson-Nernst-Planck) models.
Numerical integration of the resulting system of partial differential equation. 
Proposed and explored the properties of a nanopore-based ionic MOSFET-like transistor.

**Other topics of interest:** 
Functional programming and language design. Process calculi and models of concurrency. Formal methods. Linear Logic. 
Computability and non-standard models of computation (CRNs, biocomputing, cellular automata, infinitary computability
