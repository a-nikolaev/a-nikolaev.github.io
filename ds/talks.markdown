## Projector and slides

0. If you want to show something on the screen, make slides (PowerPoint or PDF).
How many slides is enough? One slide per minute is a reasonable estimation.
0. Since the talks are relatively short, I encourage you to use one computer and just copy your slides there.
Avoid plugging in your laptop to the projector, unless it is really necessary.

## Presentation hints

0. First, briefly present the topic and what your are doing.
0. Then, explain your solution to the problem, and demonstrate your results.
0. Avoid showing code. Explain the algorithms conceptually, if it's possible.
0. Avoid running your programs, especially if it is a command line program requiring your input, make slides instead.
0. Show interesting results.
0. Remember about the time limit.

<!--
0. Please, email me your slides at least 1 hour before the class, or come early before the class,
so we can copy everything on time. -->
