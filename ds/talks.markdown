## Projector and slides

0. Since the talks are very short, there will be no time to plug your laptop to the projector.
Everyone will be using the same computer.
0. If you want to show something on the screen, make slides (PowerPoint or PDF).
How many slides is enough? One slide per minute is a reasonable estimation.
0. Please, email me your slides at least 1 hour before the class, or come early before the class,
so we can copy everything on time.

## Presentation hints

0. First, briefly present the topic and what your are doing.
Then, explain your solution to the problem, and demonstrate your results.
0. Avoid showing code (not enough time for that). Explain the algorithm conceptually, if it's possible.
0. Show interesting results.
0. Remember about the time limit.
