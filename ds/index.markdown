Midterm 2. May 9, 2014.   
The practice exam is posted on Blackboard. It was the final exam last semester,
so it was made to be 2 hours long. Your midterm will be shorter, of course.
Also, since we did not spend a lot of time on countable/uncountable sets,
you will not get problems on this topic. So, don't worry that problem 5 looks a bit cryptic for you.
(Although, you have enough knowledge to solve it, actually).

## Syllabus

Tue, Fri, 11:10 am - 12:25 pm. North C-004.  
Office hours: after the class or by appointment.

Instructor: Alexey Nikolaev  
Website: <http://a-nikolaev.github.io/ds/>  
Email: a<span style="color:#969086;">(my last name)</span>@gradcenter.cuny.edu  
Office: HN 1000C  

### Literature
1. Rosen "Discrete Mathematics and its Applications" edition 6 or 7.
2. Lehman and Leighton "Mathematics for Computer Science" (2004).
[![pdf][pdfimg]](/docs/mit-mathcs.pdf)

### Grading Policy
  Homeworks every week (Due Friday). No late homeworks accepted. Homeworks must be handed in at the beginning of the class.

####Distribution  
  
  HWs: 25%  
  Midterm I, Midterm II, Final: 37.5% + 37.5%.  

  The Final is cumulative. *The worst exam out of three will be dropped*, so the total final score is computed as follows:
  
  X = HW * 0.25 + MAX((M1 + M2), (M1 + F), (M2 + F)) * 0.5 * 0.75

  However, you still have to attend and write the final exam,
  even if you already have 100% for the midterms.

####Project    
  An optional project is a possibility to improve your grade, and (hopefully) do something fun.

  More details will be added later.
  
<!--
  If your total grade X = HWs + Exams is a number between 0 and 1, and if your grade for the project is P (again, a number between 0 and 1), 
  then the additive bonus is 0.1 * P * (1-X/2). Effectively, it gives you a bonus between 5% and 10%, depending on your 
  total grade X. 

  Your project topic should be formulated no later than November 15. I will post more information about choosing a project later.

  There are two midterms and the final. When computing the final grade,
  only two best exams out of three are counted, and
  the worst is dropped:

  X = HW * 0.25 + MAX((M1 + M2), (M1 + F), (M2 + F)) * 0.5 * 0.75

  However, you still have to attend and write the final exam,
  even if you already have 100% for the midterms.
