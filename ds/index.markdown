## Discrete Structures, CSCI-150.

Lecture 1. Jan 30, 2017. [Propositional Logic](/ds/docs/lec1.pdf).   
Reading: R(ed6): 1.1-1.2; R(ed7): 1.1-1.3.   
[HW1](/ds/docs/hw1.pdf). Due Monday, Feb 6.
(Notice that only problems 2, 3, and 5 will be graded; you don't have to write your solutions for the other problems).

Lecture 2. Feb 1, 2017. [Satisfiability and Rules of Inference](/ds/docs/lec2.pdf). \[[handout](/ds/docs/cc1.pdf)\].  
Reading: R(ed6): 1.5; R(ed7): 1.6.  
Useful links:

You may also read more in depth on [Natural Deduction proofs](https://whythis.s3.amazonaws.com/media/teaching/lecturenotes/natural_deduction.pdf),
it's using tree-like proof structure instead of the linear one, but fear not.

Also, you can play this logical game: [http://incredible.nomeata.de/](http://incredible.nomeata.de/), where you are constructing 
proofs out of blocks ([an example](http://i.imgur.com/CFrgtAW.png)). Those blocks are essentially the inference rules we learned in Lecture 2,
but you are provided with only some of those rules.

## Syllabus

Mon, Wed, 8:25 - 9:40 pm. Hunter North C107.  
Office hours: after the class or by appointment.

Instructor: Alexey Nikolaev  
Website: <http://a-nikolaev.github.io/ds/>  
Email: a<span style="color:#969086;">(my last name)</span>@gradcenter.cuny.edu  
Office: HN 1000C  

### Literature
1. Rosen "Discrete Mathematics and its Applications" edition 6 or 7.
2. Lehman and Leighton "Mathematics for Computer Science" (2004).
[![pdf][pdfimg]](/docs/mit-mathcs.pdf)

### Grading Policy
  Homeworks once a week. No late homeworks accepted. Homeworks must be handed in at the beginning of the class.

**Distribution**  
  HWs: 25%  
  Midterm I + Midterm II + Final: 37.5% + 37.5%.  

  The Final is cumulative. *The worst exam out of three will be dropped*, so the total final score is computed as follows:
  
  X = HW * 0.25 + MAX{(M1 + M2), (M1 + F), (M2 + F)} * 0.5 * 0.75

  However, you still have to attend and write the final exam,
  even if you already have 100% for the midterms.

**Project**    
  An optional project is a possibility to improve your grade, and (hopefully) do something fun.
  [More details about projects & possible topics](/ds/topics.html).

Review Session. May 6, 2014. [Problem set](/ds/docs/cc5.pdf)  

Midterm 2. May 9, 2014.   
The practice exam is posted on Blackboard. It was the final exam last semester,
so it was made to be 2 hours long. Your midterm will be shorter, of course.
Also, since we did not spend a lot of time on countable/uncountable sets,
you will not get problems on this topic. So, don't worry that problem 5 looks a bit cryptic for you.
(Although, you have enough knowledge to solve it, actually).

Projects presentation. May 13, 2014.    
[Possible Project Topics](/ds/topics.html).    
[Information for the speakers](/ds/talks.html).    
[Schedule](/ds/presentation.html).


Final Exam. May 19, 2014 (Notice, this is Monday). 9:00 - 11:00am. The same room.

<!--
  If your total grade X = HWs + Exams is a number between 0 and 1, and if your grade for the project is P (again, a number between 0 and 1), 
  then the additive bonus is 0.1 * P * (1-X/2). Effectively, it gives you a bonus between 5% and 10%, depending on your 
  total grade X. 

  Your project topic should be formulated no later than November 15. I will post more information about choosing a project later.

  There are two midterms and the final. When computing the final grade,
  only two best exams out of three are counted, and
  the worst is dropped:

  X = HW * 0.25 + MAX((M1 + M2), (M1 + F), (M2 + F)) * 0.5 * 0.75

  However, you still have to attend and write the final exam,
  even if you already have 100% for the midterms.
