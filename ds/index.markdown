Some of you asked for **office hours this Friday** (October 3). I will be available after 5pm, if you need help. If it's possible, email in advance,
so I can plan my day better.

Review Session. May 6, 2014. [Problem set](/ds/docs/cc5.pdf)  

Midterm 2. May 9, 2014.   
The practice exam is posted on Blackboard. It was the final exam last semester,
so it was made to be 2 hours long. Your midterm will be shorter, of course.
Also, since we did not spend a lot of time on countable/uncountable sets,
you will not get problems on this topic. So, don't worry that problem 5 looks a bit cryptic for you.
(Although, you have enough knowledge to solve it, actually).

## Syllabus

Mon, Wed, 7:00 pm - 8:15 pm. North 1516.  
Office hours: after the class or by appointment.

Instructor: Alexey Nikolaev  
Website: <http://a-nikolaev.github.io/ds/>  
Email: a<span style="color:#969086;">(my last name)</span>@gc.cuny.edu  
Office: HN 1000C  

### Literature
1. Rosen "Discrete Mathematics and its Applications" edition 6 or 7.
2. Lehman and Leighton "Mathematics for Computer Science" (2004).
[![pdf][pdfimg]](/docs/mit-mathcs.pdf)

### Grading Policy
No late homeworks accepted.  
Homeworks every week (Due Wednesday). 

####Distribution  
  HWs: 25%  
  Midterm I: 25%  
  Midterm II: 25%  
  Final: 25%  

  Two midterms and the final. All exams are non-cumulative and cover one third of the material each.

####Project    
  An optional project is a possibility to improve your grade, and 
  (hopefully) do something fun.
  
  If your total grade X = HWs + Exams is a number between 0 and 1, and if your grade for the project is P (again, a number between 0 and 1), 
  then the additive bonus is 0.1 * P * (1-X/2). Effectively, it gives you a bonus between 5% and 10%, depending on your 
  total grade X. 

  Your project topic should be formulated no later than November 15. I will post more information about choosing a project later.

<!--
  There are two midterms and the final. When computing the final grade,
  only two best exams out of three are counted, and
  the worst is dropped:

  X = HW * 0.25 + MAX((M1 + M2), (M1 + F), (M2 + F)) * 0.5 * 0.75

  However, you still have to attend and write the final exam,
  even if you already have 100% for the midterms.
