## General info

Doing a project is optional,
it is a way to improve your grade if you did not do well on the exams,
or just want to get some extra credit.

All projects will be due by the end of the semester. 
You will have to make a short (5 minutes) presentation in the last class, showing your work. 
Also, you will have to write a 5-6 page report, describing the problem, 
your solution, and the results obtained.

Before you start working on the topic, I have to approve it. 
The topic should be chosen **before the Spring break**.

Report you progress regularly (for example, once a week), so I can guide you, and you don't waste time.

## How to choose a topic

Read Rosen's book, in the end of each chapter, there is a section 
*Computer Projects*, where you can find some ideas.
Also, you can look in the chapters we have not talked about yet (Graphs, Sets, Probability, for example).

Find something that is interesting and seems to be related to the course.

If you can write code, choose a project that requires programming.

Try to find something you are interested in, and we will find a way to add some math to make a project out of it.

### New possible topics
1. Finding large prime numbers.

1. A program for solving [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). 
Some discussion can be found [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22342854/what-is-the-optimal-algorithm-for-the-game-2048).

1. Graph [coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring).

1. Solving logical puzzles like Knights and Knaves, and 
[Wolf, goat, cabbage problem](http://jeux.lulu.pagesperso-orange.fr/html/anglais/loupChe/loupChe1.htm) 
using Prolog (If you already know or want to learn Prolog).

1. Chaotic behavior of the [logistic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map).

1. If you like programming languages, you can try to implement yourself a simple (but Turing-complete)
language, [SKI-calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus). Although, this task is not very easy.
Consider this one only if you are good at programming and math in general. 
Here, you are advised to use languages with built-in list and tuple types.

1. Experimental analysis of algorithms (for Merge sort, Binary search, and(or) Linear search).

1. Finding the [largest connected component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_component) in a random graph.

I will try to add more topics here, but, maybe you already know something
interesting you would like to work on.

### To boost your imagination, previous semester topics:
1. [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) solver.
1. Wolfram [cellular automata](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CellularAutomaton.html)
1. [Maze generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm) with Prim's algorithm.
1. Maze [path finding](http://www.cs.bu.edu/teaching/alg/maze/) algorithm.
1. [Fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) visualization with OpenGL.
1. [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29) enctryption/decryption.
1. Procedural music generation using [ChucK](http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/).
1. Logical paradoxes (essay).
1. Automatic summarization of texts. 
1. Stochastic simulation of the 
[Predator-Prey](https://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~ese303/wiki/index.php?n=Main.StochasticSimulationOfChemicalReactions) (Lotka-Volterra) model.
1. Generation of permutations and combinations (described in Rosen, for example).
